# Alireza Shirvani

I am a professor of practice at [Tulane University](https://tulane.edu/). I have been a teaching a professor since 2021. I started my Ph.D. at University of New Orleans and completed my Ph.D. at University of Kentucky.

My research was focused on computational narratives under the umbrella of AI for games. Computational narrative intelligence teaches computers how to tell compelling stories. Currently, I no longer do research and am fully focused on teaching.

The courses I have taught:
- CS1: Introduction to Computer Science
    - Introducing students to computational thinking and the core topics of computer science. This course uses Python.
- CS2: Object-Oriented Programming
    - Introducing the fundamental principles of OOP, i.e. Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism in two widely-used languages, Java and C++.
- Game Programming
    - Learning how to write code and implement game mechanics in Unity using C#.
- Software Studio
    - Practicing software engineering workflows and methodologies, including git, agile, and task management.
